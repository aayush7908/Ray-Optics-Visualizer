a->Refraction:Refraction is the phenomenon in which there is a change in the speed of light as it travels from one medium to another, and the consequent bending of a ray of light incident obliquely at the surface of separation of the two media is known as the refraction of light

a->LAWS OF REFRACTION
aLAW[1]. The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the refracting surface at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.
s
aLAW[2]. For a given pair of media and for the light of a given wavelength, the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is always a constant.
